Dear Sir or Madam,

I am interested in working for your company.

I am very good at helping companies write extensible, fast, bug-free code, quickly and easily.  I do this primarily through the strategy of minimizing redundant code.

As an example, it is my hope that I will be releasing the second version of my JavaScript framework.  This version is designed to be used with Angular 4/5 and simplifies and accelerates Angular development, as well as providing much more flexible applications.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,

Patrick Dooley
