iTKunst - A Unique IT Management Consulting Offering

Dear Gordon,

I hope things are going well for you. It has been a while.  If you think you or someone you know may benefit from the following info, please let me know.

I would like to provide a short introduction to iTKunst's IP and Services.  I believe they would significantly benefit and strengthen your company's offerings.

iTKunst corporation has been contributing to the Ottawa high-tech sector for the past 8 years.  It is pronounced I-T-koonst.  Kunst is German for Art. We are strong believers that a successful company requires Art as well as Information and Technology.

Our approach to building systems is very much a modelling approach.  This allows one to easily create re-usable libraries: Thus reducing Time to Market (TTM) and increasing stability (near 0 bug count). Currently, the industry has some difficulty creating re-usable softeware.  We believe this is a direct result of the lack of appreciation for artistic skills in the software profession.

As an example of the benefit of this approach,  iTKunst has released two products and will be releasing more in the near future.  The most recent (and most exciting) product is a RAD tool: kWng (kunstWerk for Angular).  kWng  dramatically simplifies and accelerates Angular development.

I would love to have the opportunity to speak with you.

Thanks.

Sincerely,

Patrick Dooley.
